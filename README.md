Welcome to my take on the WebGL globe. This globe shows the relative magnitudes of the causes of deaths in different countries (categorized by injuries, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases). This globe utilizes the WebGL Globe repository made available at https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe. 

My version takes data from a JSON file (/globe/data.JSON) that I generated by cleaning data from the World Health Organization (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DTH.INJR.ZS?locations=F1) using MATLAB programs (found in the "Data Cleaning" directory).
